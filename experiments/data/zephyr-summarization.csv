At the age of 12, she began studying Pedestrianism and competed in matches in Berlin and other European cities during her teenage years. In 1875, she moved to the US and participated in the first women's 6 Day Race against Mary Marshall, coming second. She continued promoting athletic exercises for women and gave demonstrations of bicycle riding. In 1880, she shared an atelier in Florida with Maria Graves Beckett, a fellow student of William Morris Hunt in Boston. She later lived in Virginia with Emma Howard Wight. Von Hillern exhibited a large number of landscapes in Boston in 1888 and created works such as ""The Monk Felix,"" ""Evening Prayer at the Wayside Shrine, Germany,"" and ""Live-Oak Forest in the Ojai Valley, California.""

Canboulay, originally a harvest festival with drumming, singing, dancing, and chanting, evolved into a celebration for formerly enslaved and indentured laborers after Emancipation in 1834. They were prohibited from participating in the masquerade carnival events of the colonial elite and their drums and religious observances were outlawed in the late 19th century. Canboulay played a significant role in the development of Trinidad and Tobago's music, as the ban on percussion instruments in the 1880s led to the creation of steelpan music. It is still reenacted in Port of Spain during Carnival Friday in Trinidad. (See also Canboulay riots.)

Canboulay, originally a harvest festival with drumming, singing, dancing, and chanting, evolved into a celebration for formerly enslaved and indentured laborers after Emancipation in 1834. They were prohibited from participating in the masquerade carnival events of the colonial elite and their drums and religious observances were outlawed in the late 19th century. Canboulay played a significant role in the development of Trinidad and Tobago's music, as the ban on percussion instruments in the 1880s led to the creation of steelpan music. It is still reenacted in Port of Spain during Carnival Friday in Trinidad. (See also Canboulay riots.)

NBC's coverage of horse racing events, known as Thoroughbred Racing on NBC, began in 1949 with the broadcast of the Kentucky Derby on the NBC Red Network. The network's relationship with the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing continued through 1999, when NBC Sports won the rights to broadcast all three races: the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes. In 2001, NBC began broadcasting the Breeders' Cup, which it had previously covered from its inception in 1984.

In 2011, NBC announced a five-year deal to continue broadcasting the Triple Crown races through 2015, with cable coverage of the races' undercards and other events on NBCSN. This deal was extended in 2016 through 2022. However, in 2022, Fox Sports announced that it would acquire the media rights to the Belmont Stakes starting in 2023, leaving NBC with only the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.

Jorge de Lencastre, also known as George of Lencastre, was born in 1594 in Azeitão and died in 1632 in Lisbon. As the older son of Dom Álvaro and Juliana of Lencastre, 3rd Dukes of Aveiro, he inherited the titles of 3rd Marquis of Torres Novas and 1st Duke of Torres Novas due to a special grant from King Philip I. However, he never succeeded his parents as Duke of Aveiro as he passed away before his mother. Jorge married Ana Dória Colonna in 1619, but she died the following year without issue. He then married Ana Manrique de Cádenas, with whom he had four children, including Raimundo of Lencastre, the 4th Duke of Aveiro, and Maria de Guadalupe of Lencastre, the 6th Duchess of Aveiro.

Assistant: An integrated library system is a modern library management solution that combines various library functions into a single, unified platform. It differs from traditional library systems in that it offers advanced features such as automated circulation, real-time inventory management, and integrated search capabilities across multiple library locations. Additionally, it often includes digital content management and delivery, as well as self-service kiosks and mobile apps for patron convenience.","

In summary, an integrated library system (ILS) is a software solution used by libraries to manage various tasks such as acquisitions, cataloging, circulation, serials, and online public access catalog (OPAC). The history of ILS dates back to the 1960s with the introduction of MARC standards and the growth of computer technologies. In the 1970s and 1980s, turnkey systems on microcomputers, known as ILS, emerged, allowing the connection of major circulation tasks. The evolution of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s led to the growth of ILS, with libraries allowing users to engage more actively through OPACs and online web-based portals. However, in the mid to late 2000s, ILS vendors increased prices, leading to dissatisfaction among smaller libraries, and open-source ILSs such as Koha and Evergreen gained popularity as an alternative. The rise of cloud technology has also led to the increase in the use of cloud-based library management systems. Distributed software and web service are two categories of software used in library computer",4.130856513977051,12.355802297592163,616,86,1065,165,<<0>>,0,<<1>>,1,<<1>>,1
